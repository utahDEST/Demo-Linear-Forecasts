# Demo-Linear-Forecasts

Prepping and displaying the linear forecasting in this repository is done in three separate jupyter notebooks

1. Read historic estimated AADT from UDOT
2. Fit a line through the AADT using least squares regression and extend line into the future
3. Create interactive chart to visualize the data
